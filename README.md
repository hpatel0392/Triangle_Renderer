# Triangle Renderer

This is a Visual Studio project and so I have included the whole project for easy import

The application, reads in triangle data from an input ply file and then outputs the rendered object into a ppm file.

There are some test image files included in Source>Lab 5>Test Images.

** Usage **
> <input.ply> <output.ppm> <rotate degrees about X> <rot Y> <rot Z>
 
 To change the command line arguements in Visual Studio go to Project>Properties>Debugging>Comannd Arguements
